      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey Ember Hot Seat listeners! We&amp;#8217;re back this week with &lt;a href='http://twitter.com/kaspertidemann'&gt;Kasper Tidemann&lt;/a&gt;, CTO and cofounder of Meemo, in the Hot Seat. He&amp;#8217;s going to give his perspective on getting started with Ember, his journey in choosing Ember, and how he&amp;#8217;s overcome some of the difficulties. We also touch on why it&amp;#8217;s important to give back to the community and why Ember was the framework of choice for his company. Kasper made mention of his &lt;a href='http://kaspertidemann.com'&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and to a video he would record of his own JS framework &lt;a href='http://vimeo.com/68185861'&gt;meeho.js&lt;/a&gt;. I hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we&amp;#8217;ve recorded it in stereo AAAAAAND even have some theme music provided by a good friend of mine &lt;a href='http://futureperfekt.net'&gt;Mitchell Wilcox&lt;/a&gt; haha. The production quality keeps going up with each week. I&amp;#8217;m still waiting on iTunes podcast approval, but if you&amp;#8217;d like to subscribe to the RSS feed, you can do it here: &lt;a href='http://emberhotseat.com/feed/index.xml'&gt;http://emberhotseat.com/feed/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
