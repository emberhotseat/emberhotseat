Hey there {{name}},

Welcome to your boiler plate blog post. In here, we'll show you how to easily create a blog post with all sort of examples for you to re-use. This post is generated exclusively using \[markdown\](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), you can choose to create blog posts using markdown too, or simply raw HTML.

## Introduction

The heading above is a `h2` and is the biggest header you should use in a blog post. Generally, `h2` headings should be used to seperate major content within your article.

You can use smaller headings, such as `h3` or even `h2`, to seperate content within a section. This might be useful to break down an argument or discussion point.

## Common HTML elements

Markdown will suffice for *most* things you'll want to do. For example, *italics* and **bolds**

1. List
1. items

* Ordered
* or not

Code blocks are pretty easy

    (but annoyingly, these have to be
    indented with 4 spaces)

and of course `inline codes`

If you ever need to use it...

> Blockquotes are available too

And if you're feeling *really* adventurous, you can even do tables

| Markdown              | What's it do?          |
| --------------------- | -----------------------|
| `*italic*`            | Makes something italic |
| `**bold**             | Makes something bold   |
| `## Big heading`      | A `h2` heading       |
| `### Smaller heading` | A `h3` heading       |

And there's also links and images and stuff, so it's time to \[RTFM\](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
