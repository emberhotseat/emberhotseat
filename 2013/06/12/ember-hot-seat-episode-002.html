<p>Hey Ember Hot Seat listeners! We&#8217;re back this week with <a href='http://twitter.com/kaspertidemann'>Kasper Tidemann</a>, CTO and cofounder of Meemo, in the Hot Seat. He&#8217;s going to give his perspective on getting started with Ember, his journey in choosing Ember, and how he&#8217;s overcome some of the difficulties. We also touch on why it&#8217;s important to give back to the community and why Ember was the framework of choice for his company. Kasper made mention of his <a href='http://kaspertidemann.com'>blog</a> and to a video he would record of his own JS framework <a href='http://vimeo.com/68185861'>meeho.js</a>. I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>This week we&#8217;ve recorded it in stereo AAAAAAND even have some theme music provided by a good friend of mine <a href='http://futureperfekt.net'>Mitchell Wilcox</a> haha. The production quality keeps going up with each week.
