Hey Ember Hot Seat listeners! We're back this week with [Kasper Tidemann](http://twitter.com/kaspertidemann), CTO and cofounder of Meemo, in the Hot Seat. He's going to give his perspective on getting started with Ember, his journey in choosing Ember, and how he's overcome some of the difficulties. We also touch on why it's important to give back to the community and why Ember was the framework of choice for his company. Kasper made mention of his [blog](http://kaspertidemann.com) and to a video he would record of his own JS framework [meeho.js](http://vimeo.com/68185861). I hope you enjoy!

This week we've recorded it in stereo AAAAAAND even have some theme music provided by a good friend of mine [Mitchell Wilcox](http://futureperfekt.net) haha. The production quality keeps going up with each week. I'm still waiting on iTunes podcast approval, but if you'd like to subscribe to the RSS feed, you can do it here: <http://emberhotseat.com/feed/index.xml>.

If you'd like to be in the Hot Seat or have feedback on the show, please reach out to us on Twitter [@emberhotseat](http://twitter.com/emberhotseat). We look forward to hearing from you.
